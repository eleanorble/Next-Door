"When you log in to nextdoor, you see posts from your neighborhood and from nearby neighborhoods. The API scrapes the most recent data on posts from your homepage; therefore, each neighborhood (Mac-Groveland and Mound) contain data from posts from their neighborhoods and nearby ones." 

"These visualizations show how many times users from the various represented neighborhoods posted in the most recent 20 posts from the Mac-Groveland and Mound homepages. While we can't draw conclusions from such as small data frame, it seems that Mac-Groveland is pretty active while Mound is less active compared to their respective surrounding neighborhoods."

#This visualization shows the most common words in the subject lines of posts in both the Mound and Mac Grove neighborhoods. 
#Because we haven't figured out how to call the api multiple times to get a bunch of post data, and we haven't gotten the other neighborhood (prospect park) 
#and a lot of posts didn't have subjects available this was based on just about 10 subjects. We're still learning about tidy text so we can use this package to do a sentiment analysis in the future.

# This visualization shows that users in the Mac Groveland Area posted on Nextdoor most during the middle of the week, while users in Mound posted most during the weekend. There are two days of the week where only users in Mac Groveland posted, and one day of the week where only users in Mound posted. This could suggest different ways that users in Mac Groveland and Mound use Nextdoor, in terms of frequency, total postings, and weekday versus weekend usage.

# This visualization depicts the predicted gender breakdown of the combined Macalester-Groveland and Mound neighborhoods. There were some issues wrangling data so this visualzation combines the two neighborhoods rather than comparing them. Once we have access to more data, a revised visualization of predicted gender (comparing neighborhoods by both raw numbers and as proportions) will be made. Despite some issues with data, this preliminary barplot does provide some insight into what the gender demographics of NextDoor might look like. This visualization shows that the number of predicted females is more than three times the number of predicted males. It will be interesting to see if results from this small sample size are comparable to the broader NextDoor population.
